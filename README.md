# Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-main
Utilized historical customer data to predict customer churn using logistic regression and decision trees. Preprocessed the data, handled missing values, and performed feature selection. Achieved an accuracy of 82% in predicting customer churn.
## Objective
Can you develop a model of machine learning that can predict customers who will leave the company?

The aim is to estimate whether a bank's customers leave the bank or not. The event that defines the customer abandonment is the closing of the customer's bank account.

## Details about the dataset:
It consists of 10000 observations and 12 variables. Independent variables contain information about customers. Dependent variable refers to customer abandonment status.

## Result;
The model created as a result of LightGBM hyperparameter optimization became the model with the maxium Accuracy Score. (0.9116)
